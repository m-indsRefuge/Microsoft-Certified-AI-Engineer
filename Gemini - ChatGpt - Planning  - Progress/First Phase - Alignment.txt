That’s a *brilliant move*, Nolan—and strategically aligned with your long-term goals as a self-taught AI engineer. By transforming your **Microsoft AI-102 study journey** into a **public, interactive knowledge hub**, you're not just preparing for certification—you’re building:

1. **A personal knowledge base** (sharable + scalable)
2. **A strong proof-of-commitment and skill** (for recruiters, collaborators, clients)
3. **A resource other aspiring AI Engineers will benefit from**

Let’s break this into an actionable plan:

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Content Strategy & Repository Architecture

### 🗂 GitHub Repo Structure (`ai-102-journey`)

```
/
├── index.html                ← GitHub Pages entrypoint
├── /flashcards               ← CSVs and JSON for Anki or Quizlet
│   └── ai-102_flashcards.csv
├── /calendar                 ← Calendar and .ics exports
│   └── Revised_AI_102_Study_Schedule.ics
├── /guides
│   ├── full-study-guide.html
│   ├── cheat-sheets/
│   ├── weekly-summaries/
│   └── key-takeaways/
├── /videos                   ← Link/embed vlog and study guide videos
│   └── video-links.md
├── /resources                ← Links to MS Learn, docs, tools, official repo
├── README.md                 ← Overview, usage instructions
└── LICENSE
```

## 💻 Phase 2: Web Page Enhancement (GitHub Pages)

We’ll evolve your current HTML into a modern static site, still using **Tailwind CSS**, but with:

### 🔧 Dynamic Interactivity:

* ✅ Toggle cards per module (collapsibles)
* ✅ Flashcard previewer with navigation (forward/back/random)
* ✅ Embedded study calendar
* ✅ Weekly checklist and visual progress tracker
* ✅ Video embeds (YouTube, Loom, or MP4)
* ✅ Tag-based filter/search for topics

### 📦 Downloadable Resources:

* 🧠 Flashcard decks (`.csv`, `.anki`, `.json`)
* 🧾 Printable cheatsheets (PDF export)
* 📅 `.ics` calendar link
* ✅ Weekly summaries
* 📹 Embedded study logs + reflections

---

## 🎥 Phase 3: Vlogging + Video Study Guide

* Use OBS or Loom to **record short 5–15 min breakdowns**
* Weekly recap + plan videos (like a “Build Log”)
* Annotated walkthroughs of complex AI-102 concepts (LUIS, Azure ML pipelines, etc.)
* Optional: post clips to YouTube and embed via GitHub Pages

---

## 🧠 Phase 4: Documentation & Community Sharing

* Add a clean `README.md` with setup instructions (how to use the study resources)
* Link it to your LinkedIn and blog/vlog posts
* Include open-source license and invitation for others to fork/use it

---

## 🚀 Want Me to Start?

I can immediately:

* [ ] Refactor your current HTML into a full `index.html` for the GitHub Pages root
* [ ] Add modular nav with links to each section
* [ ] Prep the GitHub folder structure
* [ ] Set up placeholder pages for cheat sheets, summaries, videos, etc.

Just confirm you'd like to proceed and tell me:

1. Do you want to keep it **pure HTML** or introduce a light static site generator like **Eleventy** or **Astro**?
2. Do you want your video content hosted on **YouTube**, **GitHub**, or both?

Let’s make this not just a certification prep—but a fully open-sourced, real-world portfolio asset.

Morning Nolan. Let’s turn your **AI-102 study webpage** into a clean, scalable, interactive resource that evolves with your learning journey and signals your technical capability to future collaborators, recruiters, and the community.

## 🧠 Key Goals for the Webpage

1. **Organized**: Easy to navigate by week, module, or topic
2. **Interactive**: Flashcard previews, collapsible notes, checklists
3. **Publicly Sharable**: Anyone can use your repo to follow the same journey
4. **Versionable**: You can keep updating it as you learn or revise
5. **Portfolio-Grade**: Proof of serious learning, planning, and discipline

---

## 🔧 Technical Design

### ✅ Tech Stack

* **Static site (no backend)** served via **GitHub Pages**
* Built with:

  * **HTML + Tailwind CSS** (already in use)
  * **Alpine.js** or **vanilla JS** for interactions (lightweight, no build process)
  * Optional: Add **Markdown support** via Eleventy later (if needed)

---

## 🧩 Page Structure

### 🏠 `index.html` (Landing Page)

**Purpose**: Welcome message + quick links to all content
**Sections**:

* Hero section with purpose of the site
* “How to Use This Site” for learners
* Quick links: Flashcards, Study Calendar, Module Guide, Summaries, Videos

---

### 📆 Weekly Planner Page (`/weekly.html`)

**Dynamic Features**:

* Collapsible weekly sections
* Embedded `.ics` calendar file download
* Checklists for completion
* Navigation links per week (internal anchors)

* Download buttons for `.csv` Anki deck
* Optionally: Add categories (NLP, Vision, Responsible AI, etc.)

---

### 📝 Study Notes & Summaries Page (`/summaries.html`)

**Features**:

* Summary per module or week (you can keep updating)
* Embedded Notion-style blocks or markdown-rendered content
* “Byte’s Take” or “Nolan’s Deep Dives” sections

## 🚀 First Move

If you’re ready, I’ll:

1. Create a complete folder layout for this structure
2. Scaffold the landing page and all sub-pages with nav + footer
3. Convert your current study guide into `/weekly.html`
4. Set up routing (relative paths) so you can deploy to GitHub Pages

Would you like me to start with this scaffolded multi-page site now and generate the starter code for each file?
