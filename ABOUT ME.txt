A **Journey Page** is a dedicated section on your portfolio site that tells the story of your professional growth and milestones in a clear, engaging way. Think of it as a narrative timeline or personal roadmap highlighting:

* How you got started in AI and programming
* Key projects and breakthroughs (like *Reviviscere* and the philosophy app)
* Certifications earned (like your Microsoft AI Engineer certification)
* Challenges you’ve faced and how you overcame them
* Skills and technologies you’ve mastered over time
* Your evolving goals and ambitions

It’s more personal and storytelling-focused than a standard resume or bio. It helps visitors (potential employers, collaborators, or clients) understand your progression, commitment, and unique journey in the field.
