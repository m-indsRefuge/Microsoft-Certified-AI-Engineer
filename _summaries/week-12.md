summary: "Understanding agentic AI systems, task orchestration, and using frameworks like Semantic Kernel."
---

This week introduces the concept of agentic AI systems. We will explore how frameworks like LangChain and Semantic Kernel can be used for task orchestration, allowing AI models to interact with external tools and APIs to solve complex problems.

Key topics include:
- Agentic AI system concepts
- LangChain and Semantic Kernel frameworks
- Task orchestration
- Grounding with external APIs
