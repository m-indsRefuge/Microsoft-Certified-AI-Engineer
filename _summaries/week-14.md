This is a practical project week focused on integration. The goal is to build a complete pipeline that can ingest a document, use Computer Vision to extract text, use NLP to understand it, and use Cognitive Search to index and retrieve the information.

Key topics include:
- Combining NLP, CV, and Search services
- Building a multi-service pipeline
- Troubleshooting and performance tuning
