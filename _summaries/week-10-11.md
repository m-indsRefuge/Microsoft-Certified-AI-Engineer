A critical look at Generative AI, focusing on effective prompt engineering for various modalities. We will cover model grounding to reduce hallucinations, fine-tuning OpenAI models for specific tasks, and deploying them securely with Azure's safety filters.

Key topics include:
- Prompt engineering for text, image, and code
- Model grounding and embeddings
- Fine-tuning Azure OpenAI models
- Deployment and safety filters
