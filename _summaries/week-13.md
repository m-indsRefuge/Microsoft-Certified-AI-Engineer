This section focuses on unlocking insights from unstructured data. We will use Azure Cognitive Search to build custom indexes, create enrichment pipelines to add structure to data, and leverage Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer) to extract information from documents.

Key topics include:
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Custom indexing and skillsets
- Enrichment pipelines
- Document Intelligence
