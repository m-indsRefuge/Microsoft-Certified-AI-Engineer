These weeks are dedicated to the largest domain of the exam: NLP. We will explore text analytics APIs for sentiment analysis and entity recognition, transition from LUIS to Conversational Language Understanding (CLU), and implement speech services.

Key topics include:
- Named entity recognition & sentiment analysis
- Text summarization & classification
- Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)
- Translation, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech APIs for sentiment analysis and entity recognition, transition from LUIS to Conversational Language Understanding (CLU), and implement translation and speech-to-text services using Language Studio and the SDK.
